            <h4>
                <h3>Ans :</h3>Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. <br>
                Null
                means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined
                variable. <br>
                The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.
